Java 17 -> I tried reverting back to Java 17 (from Java 18, as needed in another class I am in), and I did this using IntelliJ IDE. Please let me know if this did not work.

Extra Credit:
- I used an image of a star instead of a ball
- I did movement between the notes, with small arcs between each note
- I added an image for each note, which shows it as 'highlighted' when it is being played

Thank you guys for a great semester!!
