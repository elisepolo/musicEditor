Hello!

This is my class project for CS 4470 - User Interface Software!

For this semester-long project, we were asked to create a music editing software using Java Swing.
The software works by letting the user create their own sheet music by dragging and dropping notes,
adding sharps and flats, and creating rests. Additional functionality was added to allow users to
save and upload their files to the software as .csv and .txt files, as well as a 'play' mode that 
animates the user's sheet music. There is also a pen mode that uses professor-provided code for the 
dollar recognition algorithm to allow users to draw their own notes onto the sheet music.

The program can be run as a jar file by running java -jar homework.jar in the command line!
